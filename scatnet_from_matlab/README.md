This folder contains scripts that allow to count scattering coefficients using MATLAB toolbox [ScatNet](http://www.di.ens.fr/data/software/scatnet/download/).

To run the scripts MATLAB software should be installed as well as [MATLAB Engine API for Python](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html).

[ESC dataset](https://github.com/karoldvl/ESC-50#download) is used to run  examples of sound classification using scattering coefficients.
